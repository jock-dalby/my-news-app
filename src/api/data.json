Almost without exception they failed to ­anticipate the presidential election outcome — and had little influence on it. Their message that Trump was unfit for presidency was largely ­ignored.\n Australia’s political media and commentariat are also out of touch. Listening to them you’d think Australians are preoccupied with gay marriage, offshore detention, carbon emissions and identity politics. Most are preoccupied with their families, their homes, their jobs, the monthly bills and their kids’ education and job prospects.","originalAssetId":"5a030df8-c1a2-11e6-b615-235175fb04be","version":"PUBLISHED","dateUpdated":"2016-12-15T02:56:43.000Z","dateLive":"2016-12-15T02:55:00.000Z","customDate":"2016-12-15T02:55:00.000Z","dateCreated":"2016-12-14T02:09:32.000Z","status":"ACTIVE","thumbnailImage":{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":{"value":"a0e050e6399a8f2c4ab53f0c32564ffe","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a0e050e6399a8f2c4ab53f0c32564ffe"},"originId":"a245fede-c271-11e6-b615-235175fb04be","origin":"METHODE","title":"Sense
